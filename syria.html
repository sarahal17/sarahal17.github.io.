    <p class="page">The cause of the humanitarian crisis in Syria is due to the ongoing civil war between two groups in Syria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Bashar Al-Assad.. The war is known to target civilian infrastructure that is deteriorating half of its health facilities. The economic crisis caused by the Lebanese its neighbors' economic drop and the falling of the Syrian pound's value by 82% as well is adding on to this as prices for food are rising. Also the increase in COVID cases and being unable to treat them is causing even more issues.
